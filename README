POMODORO TIMER 
-------------->
This app is designed to simulate the Pomodoro method through the use of a digitized timer that serves to enhance one's studying efficiency. 

The Pomodoro technique is a time-management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student. For this project, I implemented a simplified version of Cirillo's original Pomodoro technique.

This timer has the following functionality: 
- Preset and adjustable time intervals that can be started and stopped by the user at will
- Audio queues to alert the user at the beginning and end of each focus interval
- An attractive and readable UI that provides all relevant information at a glance 

Tech Stack: 
- JavaScript ES6 
- React 
- React Hooks
- HTML5 
- CSS3

Future Goals: 
- I plan to create both a mobile-version as well as a browser-extension for this application in the near future.
